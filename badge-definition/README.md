# Charleston CoderDojo Badges


Here at Charleston CoderDojo, we like to be cool, but also like to learn both from our mentors and one another.

Badges are a small part of the formula that helps motivate learners to achieve, while also allowing others,
that perhaps don't know how to code, to see all the awesome skills the learner is racking up.  And in some cases, it helps codify (pun intended)
this learning so that it can align to educational standards and practices. (See `Common Core Standards <http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards>`)

We also want to help CoderDojo learners along the way by enabling them with their own personal tools like laptops, tablets, and other aides to
help them in their goals.  To do this, we need commitment, and a way to sustain our way of learning from another.  Badges are a great way to
display achievement while also proving commitment.
